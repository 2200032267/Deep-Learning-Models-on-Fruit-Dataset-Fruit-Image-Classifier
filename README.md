#  Deep Learning Models on Date Fruit Dataset & Fruit Image Classifier 🍎🍌

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of **Deep Learning (DL) models** on the **Date Fruit Dataset** to derive meaningful insights and predictions, alongside a **fruit image classification** system using convolutional neural networks.

It contains two major components:

1. **Fruit Image Classifier**  
   An interactive Streamlit web app that allows users to upload fruit images and classify them into one of five categories: Apple, Banana, Dates, Guava, and Jujube using a pretrained TensorFlow Keras model.

2. **Deep Learning Models on Date Fruit Dataset**  
   A Flask-based web application showcasing multiple PyTorch experiments applying deep learning techniques on tabular data from the Date Fruit dataset, including model training, evaluation, and visualization.
